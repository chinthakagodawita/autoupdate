# scripts

These are very simple interim release management scripts till proper CD is in place:
* `build-test.sh`: Builds and deploys a test release to `chinthakagodawita/autoupdate-action-unstable:v1`
* `build-prod.sh`: Builds and deploys a production release to `chinthakagodawita/autoupdate-action:v1`
